## Describe use cases useState() vs useReducer() 

useState allows our functional components which used to be stateless become stateful. And useEffect allows our functional components leverage the component lifecycle hooks which were, in the past, only supported for class components

useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one.

## Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?

Custom hooks are normal JS functions, named with the prefix 'use', that can use hooks inside of it and contain a common stateful logic to be reused in other components.

## What do custom hooks usually do?

allow us to have cleaner functional components, remove logic from the UI layer, and prevent code duplication by bringing common use cases to reusable hooks.
