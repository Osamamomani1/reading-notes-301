#  AWS: S3 and Lambda

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Describe “The Cloud”**

"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world

2. **What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?**

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. ... Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure.

3. **What is auto-scaling?**

AWS Auto Scaling monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Using AWS Auto Scaling, it’s easy to setup application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes


4. **What is bandwidth?**

Bandwidth is often mistaken for internet speed when it's actually the volume of information that can be sent over a connection in a measured amount of time – calculated in megabits per second (Mbps).


5. **How do cloud providers compute service costs?**

Cloud providers determine the expense to maintaining the network. They start by calculating costs for network hardware, network infrastructure maintenance, and labor. These expenses are added together and then divided by the number of rack units a business will need for its IaaS cloud

 `Amazon Web Services` is the primary profit driver for Amazon. AWS provides servers, storage, networking, remote computing, email, mobile development, and security

* **EC2/Beanstalk vs Heroku**

We deploy a web application to Heroku and to AWS Elastic Beanstalk in production configurations; contrasting their implementations and pricing. note: This is not to say that AWS Elastic Beanstalk is the only comparable way to run workloads in AWS; it, however, is the one that most closely resembles Heroku
