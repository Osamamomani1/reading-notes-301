# Combined Reducers

### Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state


So Redux works around the idea of having a central state called a store. To change the state, a component has to dispatch an action. The action is then passed on to the reducer, which changes the state of our application

***
### What is the purpose of a reducer?
to check all cases and change the state depend on them 

***
### What does an action contain?

Actions are the only source of information for the store as per Redux official documentation. It carries a payload of information from your application to store
***
### Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
In the documentation of reducers(read it again for details!), redux only requires our reducers to stay pure. If the new state is different, the reducer must create new object, and making a copy is a way to describe the unchanged part.
