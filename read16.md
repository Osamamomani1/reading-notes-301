# Cloud Servers

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. **Describe the Web-Request-Response-Cycle**

As we start to build out web applications, it is important to be able to visualize the way information flows through the system; typically called the Request/Response Cycle.

First a user gives a client a URL, the client builds a request for information (or resources) to be generated by a server. When the server receives that request, it uses the information included in the request to build a response that contains the requested information. Once built, that response is sent back to the client in the requested format, to be rendered to the user.

It is our job as web developers to build out and maintain servers that can successfully build responses based on standardized requests that will be received. But, what does a standard request look like? We need to know that before we can start building servers that will respond successfully.

The standard, or protocol we use is HTTP.

2. **Explain what a “server” is, as it relates to the WRRC** 

a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices

Once the client receives the HTTP response, the browser will render the HTTP response body message. This message is either the requested resource (for example, a web page) or display a message relating to status code if the request wasn’t successful.

3. **What does it mean to “deploy” an application?**

a process to make our codes run online, not locally. then you can use this application everywhere.
