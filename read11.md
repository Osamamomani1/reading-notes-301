# Event Driven Applications

### Why is access control important? 

 mitigate the risk of information being accessed without the appropriate authorisation, unlawfully and the risk of a data breach. They apply anywhere access is required to perform a business activity and should be adhered to when accessing information in any format, on any device.

### Describe an application that would need access control.


Facebock, where users can update and add only to his/her informations while admin can block or dlet anything from users information

### What is a role used for?

Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person’s role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

### Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?

For most business applications, RBAC is superior to ACL in terms of security and administrative overhead. ACL is better suited for implementing security at the individual user level and for low-level data, while RBAC better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms

1. **Authorization** : permission for something to happen, or the act of giving someone official permission to do something


2. **Role Based Access Control**: is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is an approach to implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments.

3.  **Capabilities**: is a fundamentally better approach to Identity and access management today’s ACL framework for creating secure Identity and Access Management system. By tying access to key, rather than a centralized control system, Capability-based models push security to edge, decentralizing large attack vectors known as honeypots.
