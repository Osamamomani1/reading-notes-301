## Solve Programming Problems

1. Measure twice and cut once

you have to think in what you do and start excuting one time .

2. Solve the problem manually .

3. Optimize the manual steps.

4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.

5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.

6. Optimize the real code.

## Maind Thinking for a Programmer

### old way 

* Try a solution.
* If that doesn’t work, try another one.
* If that doesn’t work, repeat step 2 until you luck out.

### new way 

*is to have a framework*

* Understand : what is the problem
* Plan : how we can solve it
* Divide : to make it more semple
* Stuck : redo it again .

## Ways :

```
Five whys (or 5 whys) is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question “Why?”. Each answer forms the basis of the next question.

Five whys (5 whys) is a problem-solving method that explores the underlying cause-and-effect of particular problems. The primary goal is to determine the root cause of a defect or a problem by successively asking the question “Why?”.
```

~~~
Once a cause is identified, its root cause is explored with the 5 Whys technique. By simply asking ‘why’ multiple times, the cause of the previous cause is uncovered, and added to the diagram. The process stops once a suitable root cause has been identified and the same process is then applied to the next cause.
