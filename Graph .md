# Graph 

### (Graph )
 A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.


### (Vertex)
or node means the data object that can has other adjacent vertices or not.


### Edge 

the connection between two nodes.

### Degree 
number of edges that the node has.

### Neighber 
the connected nodes to the node.
***

## Directed & unDirected Graph

* Directed or called Digraph : that the edge has a direction and one of two connected nodes has the other, and the other one hasn't. (uni-directional)

* unDirected : both of them has the other node. (bi-directional)

***
### complete graph 

when each node connected to all other nodes.

### connected 
when no node doesn't has least one edge or doesn't connected at least to one node.

### Dusconnected graph 

when one or more nodes doesn't has any edge or node.

### directed acyclic graph is also called a DAG 

when no cycle happen in the graph.

### Cyclic Graphs 
when starts with node and returns to the same node.

### Weighted Graphs 
A weighted graph is a graph with numbers assigned to its edges. These numbers are called weights.

### We represent graphs through:

```
- Adjacency Matrix : by two dimensional array.
- Adjacency List : it is a collection of linked lists or array that lists all of the other vertices that are connected.

```

### Traversals 
will do traversals in graph with breadth first and depth first methods.

## Real applications of graphs :

1. GPS and Mapping
2. Driving Directions
3. Social Networks
4. Airline Traffic
5. Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
