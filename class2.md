**React lifecycle** :
* Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?

`render`

* What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?

`Mounting`

* Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates

1. `constructor`
2. `render`
3. `componentDidMount`
4. `React Updates`
5. `componentWillUnmount`

* What does componentDidMount do?

`it's load anything you want using a network request or initialize the DOM`

******
**React State Vs Props** :

* What types of things can you pass in the props?

`when you creat a component inside the react and you want to render it you will pas it to props you want to give. (like initial value of the counter) `

* What is the big difference between props and state?

 ***prps*** `props it passes into a component,handeled outside of that component and must be updatee there`

 ***state*** `is handeled inside of that component and can be updated inside it`

 * When do we re-render our application?

 `when the state changed inside the aplication`

 * What are some examples of things that we could store in state? 

 `counter or inside a form for checkbox or input element`
